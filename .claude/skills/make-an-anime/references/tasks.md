# Ruby entry points and task recipes

MiniMax H3 is the default animation provider. For explicitly requested Seedance 2.5 US, see [Seedance](seedance.md): `model: seedance` or `VIDEO_MODEL=seedance`, 480p by default, reference media/audio, and `seedance:complete[input.json,out.mp4]` for a saved draft at 1080p. The same shot/clip generation and review tasks apply.

`init --project DIR --story STORY.md [--references PHOTOS_DIR] [--song FILE]` copies the executable toolkit to a new project with the same `Rakefile → lib → tools` layers and adds `config/`, `audio/`, `prompts/`, `docs/`, `output/` and, when given, `references/` (the photos). It excludes installed dependencies, build caches, generated outputs and test scratch data. Each project is self-contained; install dependencies there with `setup`. Ruby 3.2+ is required by the OOP code. Run the CLI using the same Ruby used for Bundler.

All examples below are executed from the skill directory. Replace `/absolute/project` with the real initialized project path. `ruby scripts/mv.rb --project /absolute/project 'TASK[...]'` and, inside the project, `bundle exec rake 'TASK[...]'` are equivalent. CLI flags precede/follow the task; task arguments use Rake brackets. Quote bracket expressions in zsh. For file names containing commas, rename/copy the input in Ruby before using Rake's comma-separated arguments.

For plugin use, adapt Fal-facing recipes to the `anime` server's `run_task` tool and poll `task_status`, as described in [credentials.md](credentials.md). The MCP process receives the sensitive plugin key; ordinary Bash calls do not. Local recipes keep using the resolved absolute Ruby entry path from `SKILL.md`.

## Setup and inspection

```sh
ruby scripts/mv.rb --help
ruby scripts/mv.rb -T
ruby scripts/mv.rb --project /absolute/project setup
ruby scripts/mv.rb --project /absolute/project doctor
ruby scripts/mv.rb --project /absolute/project openapi:fetch
ruby scripts/mv.rb --project /absolute/project openapi:summary
```

`setup` calls Bundler, npm ci and Python venv/pip through Ruby. Install system Ruby, Node 22.12+, Chrome, FFmpeg/ffprobe and ImageMagick beforehand. On macOS install Swift/Xcode command line tools for VFX. `MV_PYTHON` overrides the local `.venv/bin/python3`; `CHROME_PATH` and `MEDIA_FONT` override detected Chrome/font paths. Configure the plugin's sensitive `FAL_AI_API_KEY` option, or set `FAL_AI_API_KEY` in the environment for direct developer CLI calls; never put the key in prompts/config/commits. `doctor` prints JSON booleans; `STRICT=1` makes missing dependencies fail. Tests require the full selected profile's tools and do not silently skip missing dependencies.

`fonts:list` scans installed macOS TTF/OTF files. Just before rendering, `fonts:copy[config/fonts.json]` copies a JSON mapping of project filenames to absolute source paths into the video's `tools/p5/fonts/`. Run with `--project /absolute/video-workspace`; see [Project fonts](animation-audio-vfx.md#project-fonts). Setup does not fetch fonts.

## New run configuration

When regenerating a video with approved character sheets and their original Fal manifests, register those identities locally without uploading again:

```sh
ruby scripts/mv.rb --project /absolute/project 'ref:import[char-dev-v1,/absolute/dev.png,/absolute/original-run/manifest.json]'
```

The service verifies that the supplied image exactly matches the source manifest's local image, copies it into the new project's run and retains its existing HTTPS URL, model and request ID as provenance. Repeated identical imports are safe; a different identity must use a new versioned RUN. Both source files must exist for verification. If a hosted URL has expired, use the normal authorized upload flow and record the replacement; do not assume that an old URL still works. This imports an identity, not a finished scene. The new project can then use `import: { ref_base: "char-dev-v1" }` and generate fresh keyframes.

Invoke each import (and each differently parameterized call to the same Rake task) in a separate Ruby CLI process. Rake runs a task name once per process, even if it appears again with different bracket arguments.

`config/generations.rb` evaluates inside `Pipeline` and returns a Hash. It contains configuration, never rake bodies or shell commands. An anime project has identity runs (one per character-age and recurring location) and scene runs:

```ruby
{
  "char-hero-v1"  => { steps: [Steps::RefBase], photos: ["references/hero/a.png", "references/hero/b.png"] },  # omit photos: for an original character
  "loc-desk-v1"   => { steps: [Steps::RefBase] },  # text-to-image location sheet
  "ep01-s01" => {
    steps: [Steps::Dialogue, Steps::Music, Steps::Mix, Steps::Keyframes, Steps::Shots, Steps::Overlay],
    **scene(480), music_fade: 0, mix: { music_db: -5, music_end: 19.5 }
  }
}
```

Shared files: `config/style.md` (the style bible, substituted for `{{STYLE}}` in every prompt) and `config/cast.yml` (one ElevenLabs voice per cast id; see [anime.md](anime.md)). `scene(frames, **opts)` sets the scene length (24fps) and skips uploading the score. Join scenes with `media:concat[out.mp4,output/ep01-s01/final_overlay.mp4,...]`.

The music-video form remains available: song sections share one soundtrack.

```ruby
{
  # image_model: and edit_model: pin another image model, e.g. Fal::Models::NanoBanana2 and Fal::Models::NanoBanana2Edit.
  "char-singer-v1" => { steps: [Steps::RefBase] },
  "ep01-s01" => {
    steps: [Steps::RefBase, Steps::Music, Steps::Keyframes, Steps::Clips, Steps::Overlay],
    import: { ref_base: "char-singer-v1" },
    **section(0, 240), plate: "background"
  },
  "ep01-s02" => {
    steps: [Steps::RefBase, Steps::Music, Steps::Keyframes, Steps::Clips, Steps::Overlay],
    import: { ref_base: "char-singer-v1" },
    **section(240, 192), plate: "ep01-s01/background"
  }
}
```

For a new identity version edited from a prior character, add a run with `steps: [Steps::RefBase], edit_from: "char-singer-v1"` and write its edit instructions in `01_ref_base.txt`. `edit_from: "s01/approved-edit"` can instead promote an existing edited keyframe. The RefBase service selects the Sunburst edit endpoint, records a new identity and leaves the source untouched. Point dependent runs at the new ID after review.

`section(at, frames)` uses full `audio/song.wav`, offset `at/24.0`, integer frame length and an empty expected-lyrics list. Set `lyrics:` to selected recognizable words if desired. Sprite scenes are the default: `Clips, Overlay` with a still keyframe `plate:`, as in the example above. The full-frame paths are exceptions that the plan must justify (see "Self-contained characters" in [prompts.md](prompts.md)): a single H3 plate uses `Video` and a 5–15 second integer duration; multi-shot plates use `Keyframes, Shots, Overlay` with no `plate:`. `track:` optionally maps names to `[x,y,size,search,from_frame]` for tracked graphics. `reference:` is an optional local reference-video path.

Set `upload_music: false` when a section only needs its local soundtrack for compositing (for example a nonsinging H3 shot with `audio: false` plus existing timed captions). `gen:music` then cuts/fits the local WAV without constructing a Fal client. Use `anim:prepare` for existing cues. `review:music` runs local metrics and marks transcription skipped; expected lyrics cannot be verified without a transcript. A `Video`, an audio-driven `Shots` item or paid `gen:overlay` that reads `music.url` requires the default upload behavior. `Clips` with a separate vocal stem uploads just its actual needed stem interval.

Prompt files per run:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `01_ref_base.txt` (or `.json`) | Character/location sheet prompt; with `photos:` it is an edit of the uploaded photos |
| `03_dialogue.yml` | Voiced lines: `name`, `character` (cast id), `at` (scene seconds), `text` with audio tags, optional `vo`, overrides |
| `03_score.json` / `.txt` | ElevenLabs Music v2.5 composition plan (`{"chunks": [...]}`) or prompt; instrumental, scene length |
| `02_keyframes.yml` | Named image edit prompts, `base`, `refs` |
| `04_video.txt` | Single-shot H3 prompt (the Video step reads this stem) |
| `04_shots.yml` | Ordered shots: `image`/`end_image`, `frames`, `prompt`, `camera`, `audio: <cast id>`, `seconds`, `from_take: run/shot`, or `still:`/`color:` inserts |
| `04_clips.yml` | H3/still/source sprite specifications and chroma/crop |
| `05_overlay.js` | p5 sketch, rendered through Ruby |

Read each step's `prompt` call if adding a new type. The imported `Music3` wrapper is optional for explicit song-generation requests; the normal skill uses the user's supplied song.

Example `02_keyframes.yml`:

```yaml
background:
  prompt: "Background plate matching the approved scene, visual style, lighting and colour treatment; no people or text."
singer:
  prompt: "SAME approved singer, full body, flat chroma green #00B140, limbs inside frame, no text."
reaction:
  base: singer
  prompt: "Same singer and framing; change only the expression to surprised."
duet:
  refs: [char-guest-v1]
  prompt: "Singer from image 1 and guest from image 2, separated silhouettes."
```

`base: false` omits the current ref_base; combine with `refs`. `base: other-run/keyframe` reuses an edited frame. An earlier same-run keyframe must appear before any dependent edit.

Example `03_dialogue.yml` and `04_shots.yml` for a scene:

```yaml
# 03_dialogue.yml
- name: kid-asks
  character: kid
  at: 3.4
  text: "[sleepy, mumbling] Dad… are you making a game?"
- name: narration-1
  character: hero
  at: 12.0
  vo: true
  text: "[warm, reflective] Programming is making something from empty."
```

```yaml
# 04_shots.yml (frames must sum to the scene length)
- name: kid-wakes
  image: kid-bed
  frames: 84
  audio: kid
  prompt: "Same restrained cel-anime look and dim bedroom lighting. The boy from the image half-lifts his head from the pillow, eyes barely open; 0.5–2.5 s he mumbles his line with small sleepy mouth movements; blinks slowly; blanket shifts. Faces on-model, room unchanged, no text, no extra people."
  camera: { move: locked-off, framing: medium close-up on the pillow, notes: "faint handheld micro-sway, no zoom" }
- name: screen
  color: "#05070a"
  frames: 48
```

Anime review tools (local): `review:likeness[run,...]` stacks character sheets under their numbered reference photos; `review:believable` checks RUN against [believable-motion.md](believable-motion.md) (action on green, treadmill runs, garbling VFX values, with warnings and a by-eye list); `review:camera` measures each H3 shot's camera move (first vs last frame) beside its directed `camera:` and writes a ~4 fps strip per shot (`review/camera/<shot>_strip.jpg`) for spotting H3-inserted cuts by eye; `dialogue:timeline` checks talking shots and cuts against the generated lines. `scene:new[run,frames]` scaffolds a scene; `episode:preview[out.mp4,ep01]` joins the scenes' finals, each leveled to `LUFS` (default −23; `LUFS=off`).

`gen:dialogue` makes the lines, `review:dialogue` checks each with paid Whisper; `gen:music` with `03_score.*` composes the score; `gen:mix` (local) ducks it under the dialogue; `anim:prepare` with no argument loads the dialogue word cues for the overlay.

Example `04_clips.yml`:

```yaml
- name: sing
  image: singer
  seconds: 5
  audio: audio/stems/vocals.wav
  audio_at: 0
  gate: -36
  key: green
  prompt: "Same singer and approved visual style. Articulate the approved opening lyric; eyebrow raise on its joke. Locked camera, flat green, no text."
- name: surprise
  still: reaction
  key: green
```

`audio_at` is section-local, not the whole-song time. Omit `gate` if it damages consonants. `box: [x,y,w,h]`, `seed: [x,y]`, `frames`, `start`, `scale` are cutout options. Use the approved full prompt directive, style and performance details in real files; these abbreviated examples only show the schema.

ruby scripts/mv.rb --project /absolute/project 'media:preview[output/clean.mp4,ep01-s01,ep01-s02]'
```

`gen:ref_base`, `gen:keyframes`, `gen:dialogue`, `gen:video`, `gen:shots`, H3 `gen:clips`, generated music/score, `review:dialogue`, `gen:overlay`, `review:music`, stems and SFX may call paid Fal endpoints. `gen:music` for an imported song is local processing plus CDN upload; `gen:overlay` uses paid Whisper unless re-rendering saved cues through `anim:overlay`. Other review tasks are local. `pipeline:all` includes paid review calls; allocate them in the plan.

For existing reliable word timings, use `anim:prepare[full-song-words.json]` after the plate prerequisites exist, then `anim:preview`/`anim:overlay`. It accepts Whisper `chunks` or an array of `{w,s,e}` / `{word,start,end}`, selects this section and subtracts its song offset. With no argument it writes an empty cue list for sketches with explicitly authored timing. It also prepares configured tracks locally. `anim:overlay` records a complete manifest even on the first local render, so `review:overlay` works without a paid `gen:overlay` call.

`FORCE=1` changes cached work; `ONLY` confines ItemsStep work to named assets. A selected partial item set will not build the complete step's board until all items exist. `NEW_REQUEST=1` allows a new identical paid request; normal retries reuse saved receipts. `history[step]`, `adopt[step,request_id]`, `pick[step,index]`, `import[step,source_run]` support recovery and reuse. ItemsStep recovery uses per-item stored request IDs and reruns; adopt/pick are for single-output steps.

`gen:mix` fingerprints its settings and source audio; changes invalidate the cached mix even when timestamps are preserved. Re-run `gen:dialogue` after line-placement/filter edits, then `gen:mix` before shots or overlays. Music-only scenes default to `music_db: -12`; scenes with dialogue retain `-4`, and explicit values win. `muffled: true` applies a local closed-door filter to a line's mix, leaving its raw take and mouth track intact. `dialogue:timeline` uses the audible `speech_at` after gating when available.

Existing shots can be copied locally with `from_take: source-run/shot-name`. `skip_frames` trims the prefix; `source_frames` selects the interval length after that prefix. Assembly rejects short sources before writing a plate. `retime: true` stretches that selected interval and is refused for shots with audio. See [staging-and-review.md](staging-and-review.md) for physical review and timing decisions.

For local particles and a repeatable light-only halo pass, see [particles-and-glow.md](particles-and-glow.md). For animation artwork recipes and sprite motion, see [animation-assets.md](animation-assets.md). `vfx:bake` requires the documented cues paths, preserves the plain picture, and finishes before `sfx:mix`.

`media:probe`, `media:sheet`, `media:frame`, `media:cut`, `media:cutout`, `media:sprite_box`, `media:style`, `media:concat`, `media:mux`, `media:upload` and `media:youtube` are listed by `-T` with their arguments. Export names denote encoding presets; they do not publish to platforms. For unlisted operations, add an OOP service under `lib/` and a thin registry delegate. Keep backend code under `tools/` and tests in `spec/`.

For detached lettering or debris in an RGBA sprite sequence, run `ruby scripts/mv.rb --project /absolute/project 'media:keep_component[output/raw-sprite,output/clean-sprite,320,400]'`. The seed is an integer pixel coordinate inside the intended subject in **every** input frame. The task preserves its four-connected nonzero-alpha component exactly and clears other alpha; it never expands or bridges components. Output must be a different, new or empty directory. Out-of-bounds or transparent seeds fail the whole sequence without publishing partial output. Touching text remains part of the subject and needs a separate mask; inspect the cleaned motion before use.

The packaging follows [Agent Skills script guidance](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/using-scripts): relative entry paths, explicit prerequisites, noninteractive arguments, help, meaningful failure codes and compact results. Ruby OOP methods own execution and delegate backend work.
